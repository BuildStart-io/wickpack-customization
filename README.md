# BuildStart.io — self-hosted WhatsApp AI bot


Everything in this bundle runs on **your** infrastructure. The only thing left on
Lovable is a single stateless function, `ai-generate`, which forwards prompts to
the Lovable AI Gateway and returns text. It touches no database and stores nothing.

```

`ai-chat` stays local on purpose: catalog, FAQs, plan quotas, order extraction and
`ai_usage_logs` never leave your database. The prompt, model
(`google/gemini-3-flash-preview`) and `max_tokens` (500) are byte-identical to the
Lovable-hosted version, so reply quality is unchanged.

## Layout

```
db/01_schema.sql        full public schema: tables, enums, RLS, GRANTs, functions, triggers
db/02_seed.sql          plan limits + first-admin template (no tenant data — clean start)
db/03_cron.sql          pg_cron jobs (queue drainer, follow-ups)
supabase/functions/     all 12 edge functions (ai-generate is NOT here — it lives on Lovable)
frontend/               the full dashboard, including super-admin and billing pages
.env.example            every variable, split by process
```

## Boot order

1. **Start Supabase self-hosted** (the official `docker/docker-compose.yml` from
   `supabase/supabase`). Keep `db`, `auth`, `rest`, `kong`, `storage`, `studio`,
   `functions` (edge-runtime).
2. **Schema**
   ```bash
   psql "$DB_URL" -f db/01_schema.sql
   psql "$DB_URL" -f db/02_seed.sql
   ```
3. **Auth**: disable public sign-ups (`GOTRUE_DISABLE_SIGNUP=true`) — this product is
   login-only. Create your first user in Studio, then run the commented block at the
   bottom of `02_seed.sql` to give it a profile + `super_admin` role.
4. **Edge functions**: mount `supabase/functions` into the edge-runtime container and
   give it the function env vars from `.env.example`. All functions verify JWTs in
   code, so run the runtime with `--no-verify-jwt`.
5. **Cron**: fill in the placeholders in `db/03_cron.sql` and run it.
6. **WAHA**: point its webhook at
   `http://<your-host>:8000/functions/v1/webhook-wsender`.
7. **MinIO**: one public bucket per business, named `biz-<user_id>`; `media-storage`
   creates them on demand.
8. **Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend && cp ../.env.example .env   # keep only the VITE_ lines
   npm install && npm run dev
   ```
9. **Regenerate DB types** after any schema change:
   ```bash
   npx supabase gen types typescript --db-url "$DB_URL" > frontend/src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
   ```

## The Lovable side

One function, `ai-generate`:

```
POST https://<lovable-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-generate
x-bot-key: <bot key>
{ "systemPrompt": "...", "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],
  "model": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview", "maxTokens": 500 }

200 { "text": "...", "model": "...", "usage": { "promptTokens": 812, ... } }
```

Errors: `401` bad bot key, `400` bad request, `429` rate limited (retry with
backoff), `402` credits exhausted, `502` upstream failure.

## Running many bots against the same gateway

This is the point of the split, and it works without changes:

- Each bot is its own self-hosted stack (own Postgres, own WAHA session, own MinIO
  bucket) with its own `BOT_API_KEY`.
- `ai-generate` is stateless, so N bots hitting it concurrently is just N HTTP
  requests; nothing is shared, nothing collides.
- Add a bot: append a new key to the gateway's `BOT_API_KEYS` (comma-separated),
  set `BOT_API_KEY` on the new bot, done. No redeploy of the Lovable function needed
  beyond the secret update.
- Revoke a bot: remove its key from `BOT_API_KEYS`; it starts getting `401`.
- Quotas stay **local** to each bot (`ai_usage_logs`, `contact_usage`, plan tiers).
  The gateway deliberately enforces no per-key ceiling, so all bots draw from the
  same Lovable credit pool. Watch total credits, and if one tenant must be capped,
  cap it in that bot's `platform_settings.plan_limits`.
- Only shared cost centre is AI credits. Everything else scales per bot.

## Security notes

- `LOVABLE_API_KEY` never leaves Lovable. Bots only ever hold a bot key.
- Bot keys are bearer credentials: keep them in the edge-runtime env, never in
  frontend code.
- All tables are RLS-protected and scoped by `user_id`; roles live in `user_roles`
  and are checked with the `has_role()` security-definer function.

## 📦 Wickpack Customization (v1.0)

This repository contains specific customizations tailored for **Wickpack**, isolating their data, behavior, and functions away from the core `public` schema.

### Database Isolation
- **Custom Schema**: Instead of `public`, this project operates entirely within the `wickpack_customization` schema. All core tables (`orders`, `profiles`, `faqs`, `ai_usage_logs`, etc.) are duplicated natively into this schema.
- **PostgREST Configuration**: To ensure the frontend can access this schema, the API Gateway has been patched. The `.env` variables now expose `wickpack_customization` via `PGRST_DB_SCHEMAS`.
- **Global Auth Triggers**: We intercept global signups from Supabase Auth (`auth.users`) using a custom script (`db/04_triggers.sql`). When a Wickpack user signs up, their profile and roles are correctly injected into the isolated `wickpack_customization` schema instead of leaking into the public schema.

### Edge Functions
- **Independent Functions**: All Edge Functions have been cloned and suffixed with `-wickpack-customization` (e.g., `ai-chat-wickpack-customization`).
- **Targeting**: The Supabase Client `createClient()` calls inside these edge functions have been modified to pass `{ db: { schema: 'wickpack_customization' } }`, safely sandboxing all data access.
- **AI Strict Order Format**: The AI system prompt in `ai-chat-wickpack-customization` has been heavily tailored. It aggressively enforces the collection of **7 key details** before confirming an order:
  1. Product Type
  2. Size (L x W x H)
  3. Quantity
  4. Material
  5. Printing Colors
  6. Artwork
  7. Sample availability
- **AI Sales Escalation**: If the customer has complex demands, manual artwork review, or complaints, the AI now securely directs them to human sales contacts (`+94 33 22 57592`, `+94 71 777 6010`, `saleswickpack@gmail.com`).
- **Robust Order Generation**: The prompt logic was updated to strictly output the `<ORDER_JSON>` tags internally so orders cleanly sync to the Supabase database without leaking JSON tags to WhatsApp customers.

### Dashboard & Frontend
- **Enhanced Specs Viewer**: The Wickpack dashboard naturally captures complex `special_instructions` as JSON. `Customers.tsx` and `Orders.tsx` have been updated to dynamically parse these JSON fields and display them to the admin as a beautiful, human-readable bulleted list in the "View Specs" modal, instead of showing raw JSON text.
